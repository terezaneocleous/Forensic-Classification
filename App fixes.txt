Immediate fixes (for paper deadline):

- Data tab: 

1. Currently no default option for dataset selection: make upload data the default. 
2. If you press the select/upload button without a dataset having been selected, the app exits. There should be a warning message telling the user that a dataset has to be selected or uploaded in order to proceed
3. The select/upload button should be renamed "Select".
4. Numerical summaries option doesn't run and returns error message. 

- Classification tab: 

1. Multinomial method doesn't run & returns error messages on alcohol data. 
2. Both versions of logistic regression run but do not return classification performance results on alcohol data.
3. "Advanced options" refers to cross-validation information. Better call it "Cross-validation options".
4. Not possible to run the code on 100% of the dataset as the training dataset. Should be possible with performance measures calculated on the training set.
5. Classification performance measures given in the result table should be rounded (three decimals?)

- LR tab:

1. App exits if percentages for training, validation and test sets don't add up to 100. Should return error message or rescale automatically.
2. Classification performance measures given in the result table should be rounded.
